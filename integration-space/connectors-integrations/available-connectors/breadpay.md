# Breadpay

Breadpay gives merchants a payment gateway integration in Hyperswitch. It declares pay later support in the capability block below, with method-specific capture, refund, mandate, region, and currency details there. Use the status and webhook declaration in that block when deciding whether to enable it.

To connect Breadpay to your Hyperswitch account, follow [Activate a connector on Hyperswitch](../activate-connector-on-hyperswitch/README.md), then return here for connector-specific behavior.

This connector is in alpha status. Check with the Hyperswitch team before enabling it in production.


### Status and capabilities

<!-- generated from GET /feature_matrix; hyperswitch ec9d1d22bf0257b7de4d4d8bbba4e27fd520bdf7; host http://localhost:8080; fetched 2026-09-21; matrix canonical-json-v1 sha256 873f2bbfe94dc9fda3279d10e6c077a8fe4a10d38f97f3aba64d57093c5245c4; 146 connectors.
     Do not edit by hand. Payment method rows regenerate from the
     connector's SupportedPaymentMethods declaration; countries and
     currencies come from pm_filters in config/development.toml.
     Webhook flows and capture methods print as declared; the
     declaration-gap check reconciles them in prose. Edit those
     sources instead. -->

**Integration status:** alpha

**Category:** payment gateway

**Webhook flows:** None declared in code

### Authentication

The control-center configuration exposes these connector fields: API Key; API Secret. Enter them through the connector configuration form. Authentication transport and flow-specific headers are implemented in [`Breadpay connector source`](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/ec9d1d22bf0257b7de4d4d8bbba4e27fd520bdf7/crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/breadpay.rs#L99-L146) and the [`Breadpay transformers`](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/ec9d1d22bf0257b7de4d4d8bbba4e27fd520bdf7/crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/breadpay/transformers.rs#L1-L20).

### Before you start

1. Sign in to the [Hyperswitch control center](https://app.hyperswitch.io/).
2. Open the connector configuration form and provide the fields named in Authentication.
3. Use the configured base URL for the environment you are enabling.

### Webhooks

The matrix declares no webhook flow; status updates should be checked against the API. The exact event list and verification mechanism require code-level review of [`get_webhook_event_type()`](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/ec9d1d22bf0257b7de4d4d8bbba4e27fd520bdf7/crates/hyperswitch_connectors/src/connectors/breadpay.rs#L789-L805) and the connector transformers before callbacks are used as payment confirmation.
