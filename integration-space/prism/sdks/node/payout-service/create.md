## Overview

The `create` method in the Payout Service is used to initiate a transfer of funds from your merchant account to a customer, vendor, or third-party entity. This is commonly used in marketplaces, gig-economy platforms, or any business model requiring external disbursements.

## Purpose

This operation is the first step in the payout lifecycle. Use this when you have sufficient funds and wish to send money to a registered payout method (like a bank account, card, or wallet).

| Scenario | Developer Implementation |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Send funds to a vendor | Call `create` with the vendor's bank account details and payout amount. |
| Refund a customer via an alternative method | Provide the customer's wallet or card details in the `payoutMethodData`. |
