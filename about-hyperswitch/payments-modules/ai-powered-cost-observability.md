# Cost Observability

Enterprises often face challenges and find difficulty in understanding and managing their payment processing costs, due to complexity, variability of the underlying fee structures and the entities involved. These fees typically consist of:

**Interchange Fees**: Paid to the customer bank for processing a card-based transaction. These fees vary based on factors such as card type, transaction type, region and certain qualification criteria defined by card networks.

**Scheme Fees:** Paid to card networks (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) to cover the costs of maintaining and operating their global payment infrastructure. These fees often include charges for fraud prevention, security, network maintenance and also penalties for non-compliance.

**Acquirer Fees**: Fees imposed by payment acquirers or processors on merchants managing and processing card transactions.

The complexity of these fee structures, combined with the need to manage multiple scheme categories, interchange programs, and Payment Service Providers (PSPs), makes the process particularly challenging for businesses to understand and solve payment costs.

Hyperswitch Cost Observability solves this problem by transforming unstructured payment fee data from multiple sources into comprehensive insights, providing better visibility into payment costs for different user personas within an organization. It enables businesses to monitor card payment cost, detect monthly anomalies (cost spikes), and identify optimization opportunities to reduce payment costs efficiently.

### Key Features

**Observe/Monitor**: Monitor trends across cost categories such as interchange fees, downgrades, scheme fees, and processor fees over different periods of time (e.g., 1 to N months). This system enables businesses to identify anomalies and cost deviations improving payment cost visibility.

**Audit**: Detects discrepancies such as PSP errors, invoice mismatches, overcharges. This auditing process often uncovers significant cost savings without requiring additional engineering effort.

**Optimize**: Offers actionable insights designed to help businesses achieve maximum savings by improving interchange qualifications, reducing scheme fees, and minimizing penalties. These recommendations ensure proactive cost optimization insights.

**Forecast:** Merchants can forecast the cost impact of network updates on their payment costs for any organization via brand/region/connector with monthly deltas and effective dates.&#x20;
