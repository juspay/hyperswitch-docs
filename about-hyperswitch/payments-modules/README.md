# Payments Modules

Hyperswitch offers a **modular, open-source payments infrastructure** designed for flexibility and control. Apart from our Payment Suite offering, this solution allows businesses to **pick and integrate only the modules they need** on top of their existing payment stack without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in.

Each module is **independent and purpose-built** to optimize different aspects of payment processing:
