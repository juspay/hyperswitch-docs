Local Setup guide:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

````
git clone https://github.com/juspay/decision-engine.git
cd decision-engine

---

## 2. Install Docker

Make sure Docker is installed on your system.
You can download and install Docker Desktop from the below links.

- Mac - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/
- Windows - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
- Linux - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/

---

## 3. Run the Project

### a. First-Time Setup

If you're setting up the environment for the first time, run:

```bash
make init
````

This command performs the following under the hood:

```
docker-compose run --rm db-migrator && docker-compose up open-router
```

This will:

* Set up the environment
* Set up the database with the required schema
* Sets up redis and the server for running the application
* Push the configs defined in the config.yaml & the static rules defined for routing in priority\_logic.txt to the DB

#### b. Start the Server (without resetting DB)

If the DB schema is already set up and you don't want to reset the DB, use:

```
make run
```

**System Requirements:** Approximately 2GB of disk space

After successful setup, the server will start running.

#### Once the server is setup, you can refer to the [API reference](https://github.com/juspay/decision-engine/blob/main/docs/api-reference1.md) for usage
