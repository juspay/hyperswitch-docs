# Reconciliation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:

Reconciliation V2 is currently in Beta. For Reconciliation V1, please check here.

We will continue to support Reconciliation V1 for all existing merchants. With the launch of V2, reconciliation is now a configurable experience — merchants will have the choice to continue with V1 or opt into V2 directly from the dashboard

All your existing configurations and setups will seamlessly carry over to V2 with no additional effort required on your end. We recommend beginning the transition to Reconciliation V2 to take advantage of the latest features.

Reconciliation is critical for businesses to verify that every customer payment successfully flows through the payment gateway/ acquirer/ processor into the business’s bank account. Without accurate reconciliation, companies risk missed settlements, revenue leakage, failed refunds, and financial reporting errors - directly impacting cash flow, compliance, and trust.&#x20;

The reconciliation problem is further compounded by following factors:

* Different acquirers provide files in inconsistent formats, with uneven settlement schedules, varied fee structures, and unpredictable reversals
* Refunds, disputes, and partial settlements often follow fragmented workflows, while providers use different terminology for the same status, making it hard to maintain a clear audit trail
* Banks further complicate matters with lump-sum deposits, posting delays, hidden charges, and partial or reversed credits

Juspay hyperswitch reconciliation module automates and scales financial operations by centralizing transactional data, business rules, and an accounting-grade ledger into one operationally simple interface.

This means hours of manual matching across silos, limited visibility into cash flow, higher risk of errors during closing cycles, and unreliable forecasts based on expected rather than reconciled funds.
