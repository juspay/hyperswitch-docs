# Reconciliation

Are you truly confident that every customer payment lands in your bank account? For most businesses, the path from transaction to settlement is a complex maze of different providers, inconsistent data, and manual checks—a system ripe for revenue leakage, reporting errors, and compliance risks

The reconciliation problem is further compounded by following factors:

* Different acquirers provide files in inconsistent formats, with uneven settlement schedules, varied fee structures, and unpredictable reversals
* Refunds, disputes, and partial settlements often follow fragmented workflows, while providers use different terminology for the same status, making it hard to maintain a clear audit trail
* Banks further complicate matters with lump-sum deposits, posting delays, hidden charges, and partial or reversed credits

Our Reconciliation Module is built on a powerful, accounting-grade ledger, applying the precision of double-entry bookkeeping to your entire payment flow
