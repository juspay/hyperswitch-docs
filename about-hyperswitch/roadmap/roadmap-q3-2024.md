# Previous Roadmap - Q3 2024

🗺️ Our Roadmap typically pans out over a 3-month period and we establish topics we work on upfront.

Before the beginning of every quarter we come together to develop the next roadmap based on our core values, previous roadmap, findings over the previous quarter, what we heard from the community as feature requests.

👂And as always, we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed.

### Core Values <a href="#core-values" id="core-values"></a>

Our core values have pretty much remained the same since the early days and here they are:

* Make payments more `accessible` and `affordable` to every digital business
* Staying `simple` and `super-lightweight`, and at the same time `reliable` and `scalable` payment switch
* Being `community-first` in ideation, planning and execution of features

### Themes for Roadmap <a href="#themes-for-roadmap" id="themes-for-roadmap"></a>

There are a lot of problems to be solved in payments, but our majority of our current focus falls under 5 themes below.

🌎 **Community Feature Requests:** Most of our community feature requests falls under one of the above themes, but we still keep this as a separate theme, because we intend to actively explore new problem statements and themes from the community before scheduling actual feature work.

👨‍💻 **Developer Experience:** Providing a great self-service and self-installation experience for developers who wish to use or contribute back to Hyperswitch.

💰 **Reducing Payment Costs:** Payments should be like a free utility for digital businesses. Any business should be able reduce payment processing costs by embracing the diversity in payments.

📈 **Improving Authorization Rates:** Ensuring a best-in-class payment experience and access to latest innovations in the payments ecosystem for all businesses.

👍 **Reducing Payment Operations:** Managing payments across multiple countries, currencies and processors should not add to the administrative burden on businesses. Hence, Hyperswitch intends to eliminate all such operational burdens so that businesses can focus on the core activities.
