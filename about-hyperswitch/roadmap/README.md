# Roadmap - Q4 2025

üó∫Ô∏è Our Roadmap typically pans out over a 3-month period and we establish topics we work on upfront.

Before the beginning of every quarter we come together to develop the next roadmap based on our core values, previous roadmap, findings over the previous quarter, what we heard from the community as feature requests.

üëÇAnd as always, we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed.

#### Core Values <a href="#core-values" id="core-values"></a>

Our core values have pretty much remained the same since the early days and here they are:

* Make payments more `accessible` and `affordable` to every digital business
* Staying `simple` and `super-lightweight`, and at the same time `reliable` and `scalable` payment switch
* Being `community-first` in ideation, planning and execution of features

### Themes for Roadmap <a href="#themes-for-roadmap" id="themes-for-roadmap"></a>

Earlier this year, Hyperswitch was made more modular to provide businesses with focused solutions to specific payment-related problems. Hence, our roadmap, starting this quarter, will be published under each module. A summary of the 8 product modules is provided below :

1. **Core Orchestration:** The core module supporting workflows unifying various connector
2. **Vault:** Simplifying PCI compliance and data privacy regulations through a standalone Card Vault
3. **Cost Observability:** Tracking and reducing payment processing costs via PSP reports.
4. **Authentication:** Data driven 3DS routing decision system and unified authentication SDK to encompass the diversity of authentication products.
5. **Intelligent Routing:** Routing service to dynamically select the most optimal PSP/ network in real time exploring/exploiting/managing multiple objectives simultaneously.
6. ‚Äã‚Äã**Alternate Payment Method Widgets:** Embracing the ever expanding diversity of payment methods and payment experiences through orchestration, and a simple add-on button to Checkout.
7. **Revenue Recovery:** A payment recovery sub-system with a customizable retry engine that reduces passive churn to recover failed subscription payments.
8. **Reconciliation:** Improving Finops efficiency in multi-acquirer settlement reconciliation.

## Roadmap <a href="#roadmap" id="roadmap"></a>

Our team is currently refining the upcoming roadmap through active internal discussions and community feedback. We are aligning priorities across ongoing initiatives and newly proposed features to ensure a thoughtful, high-impact plan. The updated version will be published soon.
