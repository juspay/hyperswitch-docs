# Roadmap - Q3 2025

üó∫Ô∏è Our Roadmap typically pans out over a 3-month period and we establish topics we work on upfront.

Before the beginning of every quarter we come together to develop the next roadmap based on our core values, previous roadmap, findings over the previous quarter, what we heard from the community as feature requests.

üëÇAnd as always, we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed.

#### Core Values <a href="#core-values" id="core-values"></a>

Our core values have pretty much remained the same since the early days and here they are:

* Make payments more `accessible` and `affordable` to every digital business
* Staying `simple` and `super-lightweight`, and at the same time `reliable` and `scalable` payment switch
* Being `community-first` in ideation, planning and execution of features

### Themes for Roadmap <a href="#themes-for-roadmap" id="themes-for-roadmap"></a>

Earlier this year, Hyperswitch was made more modular to provide businesses with focused solutions to specific payment-related problems. Hence, our roadmap, starting this quarter, will be published under each module. A summary of the 8 product modules is provided below :

1. **Core Orchestration:** The core module supporting workflows unifying various connector
2. **Vault:** Simplifying PCI compliance and data privacy regulations through a standalone Card Vault
3. **Cost Observability:** Tracking and reducing payment processing costs via PSP reports.
4. **Authentication:** Data driven 3DS routing decision system and unified authentication SDK to encompass the diversity of authentication products.
5. **Intelligent Routing:** Routing service to dynamically select the most optimal PSP/ network in real time exploring/exploiting/managing multiple objectives simultaneously.
6. ‚Äã‚Äã**Alternate Payment Method Widgets:** Embracing the ever expanding diversity of payment methods and payment experiences through orchestration, and a simple add-on button to Checkout.
7. **Revenue Recovery:** A payment recovery sub-system with a customizable retry engine that reduces passive churn to recover failed subscription payments.
8. **Reconciliation:** Improving Finops efficiency in multi-acquirer settlement reconciliation.

## Roadmap <a href="#roadmap" id="roadmap"></a>

### **Core Orchestration**

* Expand Hyperswitch with new payment connector integrations including Worldpay Vantiv, Payload, Dwolla, Bluecode, Checkbook.io, Trust Payments, Nordea, and Silverflow
* Extend support for additional payment methods across existing integrations such as Multisafe, Airwallex, Braintree, and Fiserv
* Introduce split payment support across - Gift cards, Long-term lending/leasing providers

* Asynchronous chargeback handling for connectors without webhook support
* L2 and L3 card data enablement across key acquirers

### **Vault**

### **Authentication**

* Improve authentication rates and user experience with EMVCo certified Juspay 3DS Server and Juspay 3DS SDK
* Authentication Observability to provide analytics and insights to merchants with tightly coupled Acquirer 3DS for better authentication and authorization results.

### **Revenue Recovery**

* Open-source revenue recovery: Merchants will be able to self-deploy Hyperswitch's integrations and intelligence services onto their own stack
* Multi-card retries: The system will intelligently utilize payment methods already present with the customer to perform retries on a given invoice
* Intelligent invoice retrying: Automatically retries invoices declined due to hard decline error codes, within the retry budget specified by the merchant
* Custom subscription support: Enables integration with the merchant‚Äôs in-house subscription management platform to recover failed payments

### **Intelligent Routing**

* Audit Trail and observability dashboard: Allows monitoring of performance across various routing modules
* Extension of Least Cost Routing to wallet payments: Includes Apple Pay and Google Pay

### **Cost Observability**

* Smarter Fee Attribution Engine: Enhancing our system‚Äôs ability to accurately derive fee names from fragmented or ambiguous reports, fee rates and attribute costs across key dimensions such as card variants, acquirers, and funding sources
* Conversational AI Interface: Introducing an intuitive, AI-powered chat experience that allows users to explore their payment processing fees through a rich, context-aware interface, making cost observability more interactive, insightful, and user-friendly
* Expanded Acquirer Coverage: Adding support for five or more new acquirer report formats, enabling broader compatibility and faster onboarding for merchants working with a variety of providers

### Reconciliation

* N‚Äëway ingestion & transformation: implement backend‚Äëconfigured pipelines for any mix of OMS, PSP and bank asources to define normalization and transformation rules
* Reconciliation summary views: display real‚Äëtime n‚Äëway match rates, exception counts and trend charts in dashboard widgets, with click‚Äëthrough to transaction‚Äë vs. entry‚Äëlevel drill‚Äëdowns and one‚Äëclick resolution actions.
* Transaction‚Äëlevel audit logs: capture every transaction event in full detail with immutable records to ensure no information is lost
* Custom export & reporting: enable merchants to generate and download tailored reconciliation reports
* Adyen integration & auto‚Äëfetch: provide a one‚Äëclick Adyen connector that securely pulls transactions on a schedule, auto‚Äëmaps fields and normalizes into your unified schema
