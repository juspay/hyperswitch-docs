# Overview

Hyperswitch is an open-source payments platform from [Juspay](https://juspay.io/us), designed to simplify global payments for digital businesses. [Juspay](https://juspay.io/us) has been a global leader offering payment infrastructure solution for banks and merchants for **12+ years**, processing over **200 million daily transactions** and an annualized total payment value of **$900 billion**.

#### We offer two distinct solutions:

### **Our Philosophy:**

At Juspay, we believe that payments infrastructure should be transparent, adaptable, and built for merchant control—not vendor lock-in. That’s why we made the bold decision to take our Payment Orchestrator open source.

Enterprise merchants operate in a world where payment agility is a competitive advantage. Traditional closed-loop platforms dictate their own rules, pricing, and pace of innovation. Based on our 12-years of experience building and scaling global payment systems, we decided to take a different approach—giving merchants the power to customize, optimize, and scale payments to fit their unique business needs.

Guided by the learnings from our enterprise go-lives, we have been working on unbundling a range of stand-alone solutions from our broader technology stack to make them more accessible to merchants looking to expand their in-house system engineering capability. These stand-alone solutions range from services for intelligent / dynamic payment routing, payment methods vaulting, cost observability, PSP-agnostic authentication, and an APMs widget that can be embedded anywhere.

### Technical Foundation:

HyperSwitch's technical architecture combines open source innovation with enterprise-grade reliability, built to power modern payment operations.

#### Our Open Source Foundation:

* **Complete Transparency & Confidence**: Full visibility into payment orchestration with no black boxes, enabling informed decision-making and customization
* **Open Roadmap & Innovation**: Collaborative development approach that allows merchants to influence and contribute to the platform's evolution
* **Speed to Market**: Accelerate implementation and changes by building consensus faster through transparent architecture

#### Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure:

* Built on battle-tested systems by Juspay's 1000+ engineers, the same team that powers 175M+ transactions daily for enterprises like Amazon, Agoda and Zurich
* Comprehensive security framework including PCI compliance, tokenization, and security certifications
* Proven reliability at scale, designed for high-performance payment processing

### Core Capabilities:

It is built on the principles of - **Modular, Composable, Well Architected**

* **Sub-systems**: To orchestrate a unified checkout, payment methods and credentials (tokens, PANs), trust providers, dynamic routing - across PSPs & acquirers, and debit networks, designed for redundancy & reliability, state-of-the-art transaction level payments intelligence to increase conversions and reduce costs, and to unify payment operations - observability, optimizations, reconciliation.
* **Modular**: Pick only the components you need—intelligent routing, vault, reconciliation, cost observability, smart retries, APM widgets—without overhauling your stack.
* **Scalable**: Ability to handle peakings transactions up to 5K TPS (horizontal scaling)
* **Reliable**: Ensuring zero downtime and safe mode for handling exceptions (with retries, multi-region, Active-active)
* **Observable**: Providing deep insights into transactions and failures (logging, monitoring, tracing, drill downs, audits, optimizations - auth-lift and cost reduction)
* **Composable**: Easily integrate Hyperswitch into any existing payments infrastructure, reducing migration friction.
* **Future-proof**: Swap out or upgrade internal systems and providers without rebuilding from scratch—a level of flexibility closed platforms can’t match.

**Get ready! We welcome you to the future of digital payments!**
