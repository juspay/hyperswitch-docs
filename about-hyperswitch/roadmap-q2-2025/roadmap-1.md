# Previous roadmap - Q1 2024

🗺️ Our Roadmap typically pans out over a 3-month period and we establish topics we work on upfront.

Before the beginning of every quarter we come together to develop the next roadmap based on our core values, [previous roadmap](roadmap-1-1.md), findings over the previous quarter, what we heard from the community as feature requests.

👂And as always, we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed.

## Core Values <a href="#core-values" id="core-values"></a>

Our core values have pretty much remained the same since the early days and here they are:

* Make payments more `accessible` and `affordable` to every digital business
* Staying `simple` and `super-lightweight`, and at the same time `reliable` and `scalable` payment switch
* Being `community-first` in ideation, planning and execution of features

## Roadmap <a href="#roadmap" id="roadmap"></a>

### Community Feature Requests <a href="#community-feature-requests" id="community-feature-requests"></a>

* 🟩 Card vault enhancements to support more use cases - enable vaulting before payment, card fingerprinting
* 🟩 Enhance MIT payments (Merchant Initiated Transactions) to accept `raw card data` and `network_reference_id.` This will allow for payment gateway agnostic MIT payments
* _(removed from the Q1 roadmap)_ Enabling card transactions using `payment gateway token` to ensure business continuity for merchants with card vaulted with payment gateways&#x20;
*   🟩 New connector and payment method Integrations&#x20;

    * 🟩 Place2Pay
    * 🟩 Billwerk
    * 🟩 Pix and Boleto via Adyen

    _(the list of connectors will keep expanding as we receive more requests from the community!!! )_
