These roles are designed to cater to the common operational hierarchies in most organizations.

### Custom Roles:

This feature allows organisations to create roles with specific permissions that perfectly align with their unique operational structures and requirements. Custom roles can only be created at merchant roles.

#### Steps to create a custom role -&#x20;

* Go to Settings -> Users in the Hyperswitch Dashboard.
* Switch to the Roles tab, and click on Create Custom Roles.

### Assigning Roles and Permissions: A Walkthrough

The process of assigning roles and permissions is straightforward:

1. **Accessing User Management**: Administrators can access the User Management section from the dashboard. Under Settings -> Team
2. **Creating / Inviting New Users**: Add new team members by entering their details and assigning them a role corresponding to their position in the organization. In case an email service is enabled, then an email is triggered to the invited users from where it can be accepted. If there is no email service, then the user is created for that merchant\_id with a random password that can be shared.

3. **Modifying Roles**: Existing usersâ€™ roles can be adjusted as needed, accommodating changes in responsibilities or positions. This is an upcoming feature.
