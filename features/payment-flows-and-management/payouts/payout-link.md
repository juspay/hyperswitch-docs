#### 2. [Create a payout link](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payouts/payouts--create) by using the create payouts endpoint

\- Set "payout_link" = "true" to create a payout link with default **payout_link_config** set in business profile update mentioned in Step 1

\- You can also pass the "session_expiry" field in seconds to indicate the expiry of the payout link. By default it is 900 seconds (15 minutes)

```shell
curl --location 'https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io/payouts/create' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data '{
    "amount": 100,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "customer_id": "cus_123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "999999999",
    "email": "payout_customer@example.com",
    "phone_country_code": "+65",
    "description": "Its my first payout request",
    "billing": {
        "address": {
            "line1": "1467",
            "line2": "Harrison Street",
            "line3": "Harrison Street",
            "city": "San Fransico",
            "state": "CA",
            "zip": "94122",
            "country": "US",
            "first_name": "John",
            "last_name": "Doe"
        },
        "phone": {
            "number": "9000000001",
            "country_code": "+91"
        }
    },
    "payout_link" : true,
    "confirm": false,
    "session_expiry":2592000
}'
```

#### 3. Customizing a payout link during creation:

You can also customize a specific payout link by including the **payout_link_config** object while creating a link during [payouts/create](https://api-reference.hyperswitch.io/api-reference/payouts/payouts--create) call as well. The UI is customizable during link creation. However, domain_name cannot be customized and is always read from a business profile's config.

### FAQ

<details>

<summary>Can I create a payout link pointing to my custom domain?</summary>

Yes. Your custom domain can be included in the default payout_link_config object as part of the business profile update.

This involves adding CNAME records and TLS certificates which ends up being a slightly complex process. Please reach out to our [Support](https://join.slack.com/t/hyperswitch-io/shared_invite/zt-2awm23agh-p_G5xNpziv6yAiedTkkqLg) to test this feature out with your custom domain.
