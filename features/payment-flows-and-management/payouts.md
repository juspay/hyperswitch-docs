## FAQs?

- **Can I use Hyperswitch solely for payouts without payments?** Absolutely. You can payout with embedded payments or directly to a third party by providing direct payment info or token ID.
- **What does "independent tokenization" mean?** Independent tokenization means that your card and bank data are converted into a secure token, irrespective of which payment processor you use, with Hyperswitch. (We tokenize only when the user permits us to save their card/bank info)
