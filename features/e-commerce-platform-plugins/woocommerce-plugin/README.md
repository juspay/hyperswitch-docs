### Embedded

A superior checkout experience directly translates to your business growth - improved conversion rates, heightened customer satisfaction, and enhanced customer loyalty.

### Lightweight

Your payment experience will load faster, because hyperswitch eliminates the necessity to load multiple javascript libraries of payment processors.

_How?_ Hyperswitch is standalone PCI compliant for accepting and storing card information, thus eliminating the need to load javascript libraries of multiple payment processors.

### Future proofing

With Hyperswitch private card vault, your business can exercise co control of your customers’ cards on file. No payment processor can put you in a precarious situation by simply blocking your payments, or by increasing processing fees. With the Hyperswitch dashboard, you can add/switch payment processors on the go.
