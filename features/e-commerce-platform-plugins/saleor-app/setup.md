## 2. Accept payments through hyperswitch

### Get available payment gateways

If you have configured hyperswitch in your saleor dashboard you will get hyperswitch app id, in the response

```
query {
  checkout(id: "saleor_checkout_id") {
    availablePaymentGateways {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Response

```
{
  "data": {
    "checkout": {
      "availablePaymentGateways": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.hyperswitch",
          "name": "Hyperswitch"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Initialize the transaction

To initialize the transaction with hyperswitch, one needs to create a transaction in Saleor by calling the transactionInitialize mutation.

```
mutation StripeTransactionInitialize($data: JSON!) {
  transactionInitialize(
    id: "saleor_checkout_id"
    amount: 54.24
    paymentGateway: { id: "app.saleor.hyperswitch", data: $data }
  ) {
    transactionEvent {
      pspReference
      amount {
        amount
        currency
      }
      type
    }
    data
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

You can pass additional fields while initiating the transaction through the $data JSON object. 
The additional fields you can pass include:

1. `customerId`: [Optional String] The identifier for the customer
2. `connector`: [Optional String] The connector used for the payment
3. `authenticationType`: Pass this parameter to force 3DS or non 3DS auth for this payment. Some connectors will still force 3DS auth even in case of passing 'no_three_ds' here and vice versa. Default value is 'no_three_ds' if not set
   Available options: `three_ds`, `no_three_ds`
4. `billingEmail`: [Optional String] customer's billing email
5. `shippingEmail` : [Optional String] customer's shipping email
6. `statementDescriptorName`: [Optional String] For non-card charges, you can use this value as the complete description that appears on your customers’ statements. Must contain at least one letter, maximum 22 characters
7. `statementDescriptorSuffix`: [Optional String] Provides information about a card payment that customers see on their statements. Concatenated with the prefix (shortened descriptor) or statement descriptor that’s set on the account to form the complete statement descriptor. Maximum 22 characters for the concatenated descriptor.
8. `description`: [Optional String] A description for the payment
9. `returnUrl`: [Optional String] The URL to which you want the user to be redirected after the completion of the payment operation (Mandatory Field for Payment Links),
10. `allowedPaymentMethodTypes`: [Option array of string] Use this parameter to restrict the Payment Method Types to show for a given PaymentIntent.
11. `manualRetryAllowed`: [Optional Boolean] If true the payment can be retried with same or different payment method which means the confirm call can be made again.

Response of transaction initialize 

```
"transactionEvent": {
        "pspReference": "hyperswitch_payment_id",
        "amount": {
          "amount": 50,
          "currency": "USD"
        },
        "type": "AUTHORIZATION_ACTION_REQUIRED",
        "externalUrl": "payment_link_url"
      },
      "data": {
        "clientSecret": "hyperswitch_client_secret",
        "publishableKey": "hyperswitch_publishable_key",
        "paymentLinkId": "hyperswitch_payment_link_id",
        "errors": []
      }
```

Handle transaction initialize response
- You can use `clientSecret` and `publishableKey` to invoke the [Hyperswitch SDK](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/learn-more/sdk-reference) </br>
OR
- You can use the `externalUrl` to redirect the customer to hyperswitch payment page. Additionally, this URL can also be embedded within an iframe


### Retrieve the transaction
The payment status will be automatically updated by the plugin in the backend upon Hyperswitch receiving a webhook from the connector. Alternatively, you can call Saleor's Transaction Process mutation to retrieve the status of an initiated payment.
```
mutation TransactionProcess {
  transactionProcess(
    id: "saleor_transaction_id"
  ) {
    data
    errors {
      code
      field
      message
    }
    transaction {
      actions
    }
    transactionEvent {
      type
      pspReference
    }
  }
}
```


The Hyperswitch Saleor Plugin also supports additional flows such as payment capture, cancellation, and refunds. These actions can be triggered directly through the Saleor dashboard. 

>Note: If you trigger refunds through the Hyperswitch dashboard instead of the Saleor dashboard, you will need to manually update the refund status in the Saleor dashboard.
