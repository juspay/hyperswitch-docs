## Clone the repository <a href="#user-content-clone-the-repository" id="user-content-clone-the-repository"></a>

Clone the repository from Github and save in your folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web.git
cd hyperswitch-web
```

Once the repository is cloned, switch to the project directory.

## Setup the repository <a href="#user-content-setup-the-repository" id="user-content-setup-the-repository"></a>

First install all the node modules by running the following command

```bash
npm install
```

Once the installation is successful, you can compile the app with the following command on one terminal -&#x20;

```bash
npm run re:start
```

and can run the server with the following command on another terminal&#x20;

```bash
npm run start
```

This will trigger a build of the project. On a successful build, you should see a message `Compiled successfully` in your terminal.&#x20;

Now you can proceed with launching the playground.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: The **playground** is a full stack integrated demo app where you can test your payments. In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the app on your local machine.
{% endhint %}

```bash
npm run start:playground
```

This step will prompt you to enter 3 details that you must have received in the previous step when you set up the app server -&#x20;

| **Publishable Key**                         |  This is a public key that resides on your client side for authentication                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Secret Key**                              | This is the API key which should only be restricted to your app server                                                          |
| **Self-hosted Hyperswitch Server URL**      |  This is the URL of your self-hosted[ **Hyperswitch app server**](run-app-server.md) (for eg., `http://localhost:8080`)         |
| **Self-hosted Hyperswitch Web client URL**  | <p>This is the URL of your self-hosted<a href="run-app-server.md"> </a>(for eg., </p><p><code>http://localhost:9050</code>)</p> |

{% hint style="success" %}
Congratulations! You will now see the web app running on `http://localhost:9060` where you can test your payments.

<summary>Troubleshooting/ FAQs</summary>



* **I cannot see the Web app playground running on `http://localhost:9060`**\
  Please recheck the publishable key and secret key that you have provided along with the URLs that you entered during the setup. Make sure that the self-hosted Hyperswitch server URL is your app server URL and the application server URL is the playground server URL\

* **npm commands are throwing errors**\
  Please ensure you have the latest version of npm installed on your system. Once that is done, please reinstall the client application. You can also use `yarn` instead.\

* **I don't know my Self-hosted Hyperswitch Server URL**\
  You should get this as an output when you ran the app server. Running the app server is a pre-requisite for the client playground to run. Please ensure that you have followed steps for[ running the app server](run-app-server.md).\
