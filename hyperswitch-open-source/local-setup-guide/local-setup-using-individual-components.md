# Local Setup using Individual Components

## Hyperswitch Components&#x20;

Hyperswitch has three components, and all three components have a very detailed setup considering various use cases, listed in their individual repositories-&#x20;

* **App Server -** The core payments engine responsible for managing payment flows, payment unification and smart routing.
* **Web Client (SDK) -** An inclusive, consistent and blended payment experience optimized for the best payment conversions.
* **Control center -** A dashboard for payment analytics and operations, managing payment processors or payment methods and configuring payment routing rules.

You can find the links to the repositories below, and use the one that fits your needs -&#x20;
