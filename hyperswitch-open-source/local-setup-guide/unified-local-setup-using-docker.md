# ðŸª¢ Unified Local Setup using Docker

{% hint style="info" %}
Let's hit the ground running â€“ within five minutes, youâ€™ll see a complete end-to-end example of installing Hyperswitch and making a Payment via a Payment provider of your choice. So, letâ€™s get started!

## **Setting up with Docker**

If you don't already have Docker, you can [download](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) it from the official Docker website. Once Docker is installed, launch the Docker app, then use the following commands at the command line to clone the Hyperswitch repository.

```
git clone --depth 1 --branch latest https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch
```

Once the repository is cloned, switch to the project directory.

```
cd hyperswitch
```

Now, we'll start all services using Docker Compose. This will pull Hyperswitch Docker images and then start the server. Wait for the `migration_runner` container to finish running migrations (approximately 2 minutes) before proceeding further.

```
docker compose up -d
```

Congratulations! You've now setup Hyperswitch in your local machine. In order to verify that the server is up and running hit the health endpoint.

```
curl --head --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/health'
```

The expected response here is `200 OK` status code. This indicates that the server and all of its dependent services such as the database and Redis are functioning correctly.

**Access the Control Centre in your browser at** [**http://localhost:9000**](http://localhost:9000/)**.**

In the next chapter, we'll **run payments** through your local Hyperswitch setup by setting up the necessary accounts, API credentials and try out payments and refunds.
