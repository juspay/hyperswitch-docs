## Hyperswitch and the payments ecosystem

Hyperswitch is a unified API to connect with dozens of different payment processors, each with very different internal APIs and SDKs. In other words, our payment switch is a set of payments domain abstractions, built over the capabilities of leading payment processors, wallets, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) providers and banks.

Hyperswitch can simplify your payment integrations and allow you to take full control of your payments.

Using Hyperswitch, you can:

* ⬇️ **Reduce dependency** on a single processor like Stripe or Braintree
* 🧑‍💻 **Reduce Dev effort** to add & maintain integrations by 90%&#x20;
* 🚀 **Improve success rates** with seamless failover and auto-retries
* 💸 **Reduce processing fees** with smart routing
* 🎨 **Customize payment flows** with full visibility and control
* 🌐 **Increase business reach** with local/alternate payment methods

The current payment landscape is extremely diverse, with 500+ payment processors, 200+ wallets, 130+ bank transfer options, local payment solutions and so on. Over the years, this has increased the number of fintech layers, resulting in more latency and cost associated with each transaction. In addition to this, connecting and maintaining multiple payment integrations requires a lot of development effort.

The payment ecosystem is:

* Dominated by closed systems and walled gardens
* Ever increasing diversity
* Becoming expensive for businesses

These problems can only be solved by open systems and this is what Hyperswitch is all about:

> A community led, open payments switch to enable access to the best payments infrastructure for every digital business.

## Join the movement

It doesn’t matter if you don’t come from a technical or a payments background (though it’s okay if you do too!) We made this guide to make Payments Infrastructure accessible to as many people as possible. The only prerequisite is that you know how to use a few dev tools and know some basic coding.

A Payments Switch allows you to connect with any Payment processing entity and enable any payment method without having to repeat the development or design effort multiple times. This can be achieved by a single integration with Hyperswitch. A lot of people have a misconception that you need to master all kinds of hard-to-get stuff to drive payment or even understand it.  But as you’ll see, those people are wrong. Here are a few things you _absolutely don’t need_ to run your own payments stack:

| Myth                     | Truth                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lots of Compliance needs | Just a self assessment for PCI compliance if you process less than 6 million transactions a year. 1-month long process otherwise |
| Lots of complexity       | A single dashboard to view and review all your payment metrics                                                                   |
| Lots of Expense          | Flexibility to work with any payment processor to get best prices and cut down of multiple layers in between                     |
