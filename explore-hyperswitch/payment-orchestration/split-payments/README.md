# Split Payments

**Split payments** refer to the process of dividing a single transaction into multiple parts, ensuring that funds are automatically distributed among different parties in real-time or through scheduled settlements. This is essential for **marketplaces, platforms, and businesses handling multi-party transactions**, enabling seamless revenue sharing, commission deductions, and vendor settlements while maintaining accuracy and compliance.

With Hyperswitch, businesses can efficiently process split payments, ensuring compliance, transparency, and optimized fund flow while reducing operational complexities.
