# Split Payments

**Split payments** refer to the process of dividing a single transaction into multiple parts, ensuring that funds are automatically distributed among different parties in real-time or through scheduled settlements. This is essential for **marketplaces, platforms, and businesses handling multi-party transactions**, enabling seamless revenue sharing, commission deductions, and vendor settlements while maintaining accuracy and compliance.

#### Hyperswitch Implementation

Hyperswitch provides payment functionality with **connector-specific implementations** supporting three major payment processors: Stripe, Adyen, and Xendit. Each connector has distinct validation rules, data structures, and split models tailored to their specific requirements.

**Configuration Requirements**

Split payments must be **enabled at the business profile level** through the `split_txns_enabled`, allowing merchants to configure this functionality per profile. Proper merchant connector account setup is required before split payments can be utilized.

**Connector-Specific Split Models**

**Xendit**: Supports both single splits and multiple route distributions, with flexible routing options including flat amounts and percentage-based splits.

**Adyen**: Provides various split types including balance accounts, commissions, and fees with detailed charge response tracking.

**Stripe**: Implements application fees and destination accounts for revenue sharing scenarios.
