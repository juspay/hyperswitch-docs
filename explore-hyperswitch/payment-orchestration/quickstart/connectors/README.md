# Connectors

## Why multiple processors?

As your business grows faster, there would be a need to expand payment offerings with more payment processors. This need might arise due to multiple reasons:

* Launching a business in new geography with a local payment processor
* Offering local or new payment methods for your customers
* Optimizing payment processing costs with an additional processor
* Reducing dependency on a single processor
* Migrating to a new processor, gradually, over time&#x20;

Integrating and maintaining multiple payment processors is a time and resource intensive process taking anywhere between [2-4 weeks](https://hyperswitch.io/blog/part-1-5-payment-challenges-for-vertical-saas-businesses)  and could divert your tech bandwidth from your core business activities.

## What is Click and Connect?

Click and Connect refers to the ability to quickly connect with a PSP or enabling a payment method by a few clicks on the dashboard without any development effort.&#x20;

**Step 1**: Procure the API secret credentials from the payment processor of your choice. Typically most payment processors have an online self-signup portal. In other cases, you may have to reach out to the payment processorâ€™s support team to procure the API secret credentials.

**Step 2**: Log on to Hyperswitch dashboard on test mode, choose the payment processor of choice, key in the API credentials and activate the connector.

**Step 3**: Configure the Smart Routing Rules to start routing some transactions to the new payment processor.

**Step 4**: Launch the production environment and monitor performance metrics using Hyperswitch Dashboard.
