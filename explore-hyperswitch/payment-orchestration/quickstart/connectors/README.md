# Connectors

### Why multiple processors?

As your business grows faster, there would be a need to expand payment offerings with more payment processors. This need might arise due to multiple reasons:

* Reducing dependency on a single processor and reducing vendor lock-in
* Introducing a challenger processor for better cost and auth rates
* Launching a business in new geography with a local payment processor
* Offering local or new payment methods for your customers
* Reducing technical downtimes and improving success rates with a fallback&#x20;

Integrating and maintaining multiple payment processors and their different versions is a time and resource intensive process. Hyperswitch can add a new PSP in [2-4 weeks](https://hyperswitch.io/blog/part-1-5-payment-challenges-for-vertical-saas-businesses)  allowing you to focus on you  core business activities.

### Adding a connector

Most connector integrations follow a simple click-and-connect flow on Hyperswitch using your connector credentials. However, some connectors may require additional setup details as required on the control center. The standard setup steps are as follows :&#x20;

1. You need to be registered with PSP in order to proceed. In case you aren't, you can quickly setup your  account by signing up on their dashboard.
2. You should have registered on [Hyperswitch Control center](https://hyperswitch.io/contact-sales).
3. Add the PSP authentication credentials from their dashboard into the Hyperswitch Control center. These authentication credentials vary across different PSPs. Few samples authentication combinations are shared below :
   1. Authorizedotnet -  API Login ID and Transaction Key
   2. Adyen - API key and Account ID
   3. Braintree - Merchant ID, Public key and Private key
   4. Airwallex API key and Client ID&#x20;
   5. Fiserv - API Key, API Secret, Merchant ID and Terminal ID
   6. Paypal - Client Secret and Client ID&#x20;

* Choose the payment methods you want to utilize with Authorize.net by navigating to the next screen on Hyperswitch.&#x20;
* Enable the PSP once you're done.
