# Co-badged Cards

Co-badged cards are credit or debit cards issued by banks that integrate two or more payment networks. These cards carry the logos of both a local network (e.g., MADA, CB, Dankort, eftpos) and a global network (e.g., Visa, Mastercard).&#x20;

Customers benefit from the global scope, security, and consumer protection of international networks while enjoying local perks, such as better discounts and lower fees. Co-badged cards enhance payment flexibility, especially in markets with strong local payment networks.

## What’s in it for Your Business:

* Increased Payment Flexibility: Merchants can offer customers the ability to select their preferred network, optimizing the payment experience and accommodating different payment preferences.
* Better Dispute Resolution: In many cases, for high-value items, global networks like Visa and Mastercard provide better consumer protection and dispute resolution. Customers can choose these for international transactions, while using local networks for domestic purchases.
* Compliance with Global Standards: Co-badged cards support local regulations, such as Article 8 of the [Interchange Fee Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015R0751) (IFR) issued by the European Union, ensuring full compliance while maintaining flexibility for merchants outside the EEA.

## FAQs

#### Are co-badged cards the same as co-branded cards?&#x20;

No. Co-badged cards feature multiple networks (e.g., Visa and Cartes Bancaires), allowing customers to choose the network for transactions. Co-branded cards are a partnership between a merchant and a network, offering perks specific to the merchant’s store.

#### Can the merchant choose the network for co-badged cards?&#x20;

In the IFR, Article 8 mandates that customers must be free to choose their network. In non-EEA regions, merchants can set default network preferences or automatically route transactions based on cost and success rates.

#### What if the merchant doesn’t support one of the networks on the co-badged card?&#x20;

Merchants can choose not to support one of the networks, and in such cases, transactions will be routed through the supported network.
