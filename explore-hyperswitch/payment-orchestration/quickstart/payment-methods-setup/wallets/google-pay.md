# Google Pay

Google Pay is a simple and secure way for customers to pay by adding their cards and bank account to their Google wallet. Currently, Google Pay is available through Web and Android devices in [70+ countries](https://support.google.com/googlepay/answer/12429287?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpay-in-store%2Cpay-online-or-in-apps) while iOS devices are supported only in the US and India.

Google Pay has additional layers of security embedded in its payment flow and hence Google Pay integration is bound to be elaborate by nature.
