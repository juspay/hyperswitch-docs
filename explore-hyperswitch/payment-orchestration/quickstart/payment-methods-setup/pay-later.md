## Klarna - In app flow

![Klarna Logo](https://hyperswitch.io/icons/homePageIcons/logos/klarnaLogo.svg)

Klarna In app flow in Hyperswitch is available if you configure Klarna as a payment processor. It provides a superior checkout flow for the customers compared to redirection flow.

To configure Klarna SDK flow, follow these steps. As a prerequisite, you would need to have a merchant account with Klarna. For Klarna SDK, need to add mandatory metaData object while creating a payment (/payments) from your server-side. The metaData object will look something like below.

```js
"metadata": {
      "order_details": {
        "product_name": "Apple iphone 15",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    }
```
