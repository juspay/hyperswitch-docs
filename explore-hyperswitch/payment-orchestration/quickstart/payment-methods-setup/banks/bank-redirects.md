# Bank Redirects

{% hint style="info" %}
Bank redirects will redirect the user to the respective bank's payment page to complete a debit payment.
{% endhint %}



Bank Redirects are one of the most preferred options for paying online across the world. Due to their highly secure nature, bank redirects are used extensively in countries like Germany, Netherlands, Asia, LATAM, etc.

## **How do Bank Redirects work?**

When customers select one of the Bank Redirects method on the checkout page, they are redirected to their online banking portal where they login and approve the transaction for which money is debited from their bank account. Post approval, they are redirected back to the shopping page. The transaction approval step might include two factor authentication in some bank redirects.

## **Integrating Bank Redirects on Hyperswitch**

To enable Bank redirect on Unified Checkout, you need to enable the payment methods on the Hyperswitch Dashboard. Hyperswitch SDKs intelligently display the supported Bank redirect option(s) based on the currency and the country of the customer.

For Bank Redirects, it is **mandatory** for the merchants to send the Currency and Country parameters in the CreatePaymentsIntent call.

```js
// Create a Payment with the shipping country and currency
app.post("/create-payment", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const paymentIntent = await hyper.paymentIntents.create({
      currency: "EUR",
      amount: 100,
      shipping: {
        address: {
          country: "EU",
        },
      },
    });
    // Send publishable key and PaymentIntent details to client
    res.send({
      clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(400).send({
      error: {
        message: err.message,
      },
    });
  }
});
```

Hyperswitch currently supports the following Bank Redirects:
