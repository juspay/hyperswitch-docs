# Overcapture

## Overview

In card payments, Overcapture occurs when a merchant captures (settles) an amount greater than the originally authorized amount.

This is particularly useful in scenarios such as:

* Additional charges (e.g., shipping, handling, gratuities).
* Price adjustments made after initial authorization.
* Reducing the risk of under-capturing when final order values differ.

With Hyperswitch, you can easily enable Overcapture for supported Payment Service Providers (PSPs).

### Supported PSPs

Currently, Hyperswitch supports Overcapture for the following PSPs:

* Stripe
* Adyen

üëâ If you need Overcapture support for other PSPs, please contact the Hyperswitch Support Team.

### How to Enable Overcapture

Overcapture can be enabled in two ways:

#### 1. Profile-level Configuration (via Dashboard)

1. Navigate to:\
   Developer ‚Üí Payment Settings ‚Üí Always Enable Overcapture
2. Toggle Enable/Disable as required.

#### 2. Per-request Configuration (via API)

Use the boolean field enable\_overcapture in your payment request.

This flag can be set in the following API calls:

* /payments/create with `confirm = false`&#x20;
  * /payments/update
* /payments/create call with `confirm = true`

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

* The request-level enable\_overcapture will override the profile-level setting.
* Overcapture is only applicable for manual capture payments (capture\_method = manual).

### Example: API Request

```
{
  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "USD",
  "confirm": true,
  "capture_method": "manual",
  "enable_overcapture": true,
  "payment_method": "card",
  "payment_method_type": "credit",
  "payment_method_data": {
    "card": {
      "card_number": "4111111111111111",
      "card_exp_month": "03",
      "card_exp_year": "30",
      "card_cvc": "7373"
    }
  }
}

```

### Example: API Response

```json
{

  "expires_on": "2025-09-24T11:44:55.629Z"
}

```

* `enable_overcapture`
  * `true` ‚Üí Overcapture was requested for this payment.
  * `false` ‚Üí Overcapture was not requested.
* `is_overcapture_enabled`
  * `true` ‚Üí Connector enabled Overcapture for this payment.
  * `false` ‚Üí Overcapture is not applicable for this PSP/payment.

### Monitoring & Settlement

* After authorization, merchants can view the `amount_capturable` field (under More Payment Details) to see the maximum amount that can be captured.
* Once the payment is captured (or overcaptured), the final amount will be reflected in the `amount_received` field.

### Merchant Action

* Use Dashboard settings for global enablement
* Use API overrides for payment-specific enablement
* Monitor capturable and received amounts to track final settlements
* Contact Hyperswitch Support for enabling Overcapture with PSPs other than Stripe and Adyen

‚úÖ With Hyperswitch, merchants gain flexibility in handling post-authorization adjustments‚Äîensuring smooth settlements without losing revenue.
