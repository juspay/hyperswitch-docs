## FAQs?

* **Can I use Hyperswitch solely for payouts without payments?** \
  Yes, Hyperswitch allows you to handle payouts independently. You can process payouts either through embedded payments or directly to a third party by providing direct payment information or using a token ID​​.
* **What does "independent tokenization" mean?** \
  Independent tokenization refers to the secure conversion of sensitive card and bank data into a token without dependency on any specific payment processor. \
  With Hyperswitch, this is possible when users permit saving their card or bank information. This ensures flexibility, allowing tokens to be used across various payment processors while maintaining data security and compliance​​.
