# Roadmap

#### **AI-Driven Exception Handling**

* AI-powered recommendations to help resolve unmatched transactions faster. When an exception occurs, the system will automatically analyze metadata (amounts, dates, identifiers, references) and surface the most likely matching transactions that can close the gap — so operators can review and resolve exceptions in a fraction of the time

#### Advanced Data Management

* A dedicated module that isolates problematic records during ingestion, prevents them from polluting the reconciliation flow, and provides tools for users to review and correct them before reprocessing
