## Overview

The `Reverse` RPC cancels a captured payment before the funds have been settled to the merchant's account. Unlike voids (which apply to authorized but not captured payments), reverses apply to captured payments that haven't completed bank settlement yet.

**Business Use Case:** When an error is discovered immediately after capture, such as incorrect amount charged, duplicate transaction, or same-day order cancellation. Reverse allows you to recover funds before they enter the settlement cycle, avoiding the longer timeline and additional fees of a refund.

## Purpose

**Why use Reverse instead of Refund?**

| Scenario | Developer Implementation |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Same-day cancellation** | Customer cancels immediately after capture - call `Reverse` to recover funds before settlement |
| **Processing error** | Wrong amount captured due to system error - call `Reverse` to undo the incorrect capture |
| **Duplicate transaction** | Accidental double charge captured - call `Reverse` on the duplicate before settlement |
| **Fraud detected** | Fraudulent transaction caught post-capture - call `Reverse` to block settlement |
| **Technical glitch** | System issue caused erroneous capture - call `Reverse` to prevent fund transfer |

**Key outcomes:**
- Funds recovered before settlement (typically same-day)
- Faster than refunds (no 5-10 day wait)
- Lower or no processing fees compared to refunds
- Transaction status moves to REVERSED or VOIDED
- No charge appears on customer's final statement

## Example

### Request (grpcurl)

```bash
grpcurl -H "x-connector: stripe" \
  -H "x-connector-auth: {\"Stripe\":{\"api_key\":\"$STRIPE_API_KEY\"}}" \
  -d '{
    "merchant_reverse_id": "reverse_001",
    "connector_transaction_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
    "cancellation_reason": "Duplicate charge detected",
    "test_mode": true
  }' \
  localhost:8080 \
  types.PaymentService/Reverse
```

### Response

```json
{
  "connector_transaction_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
  "status": "VOIDED",
  "status_code": 200,
  "merchant_reverse_id": "reverse_001"
}
```

## Next Steps

- [Capture](./capture.md) - Capture a payment after authorization
- [Void](./void.md) - Cancel an authorized payment before capture
- [Refund](./refund.md) - Return funds after settlement
- [Get](./get.md) - Check current payment status
