## Overview

The `CreateOrder` RPC initializes a payment order at the payment processor before collecting payment details from the customer. This pre-establishes the payment context, enabling features like improved fraud detection, session tokens for wallet payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay), and better authorization rates by associating the eventual payment with a previously created order.

**Business Use Case:** When you want to set up the payment infrastructure before the customer reaches the checkout page, or when integrating wallet payments that require a session token. Creating an order first allows the processor to perform risk assessments and prepare the payment session, resulting in smoother checkout experiences and higher conversion rates.

## Purpose

**Why use CreateOrder?**

| Scenario | Developer Implementation |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Wallet payments** | Apple Pay or Google Pay integration - call `CreateOrder` to generate session token for wallet SDK |
| **Pre-checkout setup** | Customer adds items to cart - call `CreateOrder` early to prepare payment context |
| **Risk assessment** | High-value transactions - call `CreateOrder` to allow processor fraud checks before payment details |
| **Order tracking** | Complex order flows - call `CreateOrder` to establish order ID for tracking across systems |
| **Session continuity** | Multi-page checkout - call `CreateOrder` to maintain payment context across pages |

**Key outcomes:**
- Order context established at processor
- Session token for wallet payment SDKs
- Improved authorization rates
- Better fraud detection through early context
- Order ID for cross-system tracking

## Example

### Request (grpcurl)

```bash
grpcurl -H "x-connector: stripe" \
  -H "x-connector-config: {\"config\":{\"Stripe\":{\"api_key\":\"$STRIPE_API_KEY\"}}}" \
  -d '{
    "merchant_order_id": "order_001",
    "amount": {
      "minor_amount": 1000,
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "webhook_url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/stripe",
    "test_mode": true
  }' \
  localhost:8080 \
  ucs.v2.PaymentService/CreateOrder
```

### Response

```json
{
  "connector_order_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
  "status": "STARTED",
  "status_code": 200,
  "merchant_order_id": "order_001",
  "session_token": {
    "client_secret": "pi_3Oxxx..._secret_xxx"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

- [Authorize](./authorize.md) - Create payment authorization (pass `order_context` from CreateOrder response)
- [SetupRecurring](./setup-recurring.md) - Set up recurring payments using the order context
- [Get](./get.md) - Check order status
- [MerchantAuthenticationService](../merchant-authentication-service/README.md) - Create session tokens for SDK integration
