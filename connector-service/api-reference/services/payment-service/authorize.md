## Overview

The `Authorize` RPC reserves funds on a customer's payment method without transferring them. This is the first step in a two-step payment flow (authorize + capture), commonly used in e-commerce, marketplaces, and subscription businesses.

**Business Use Case:** When a customer places an order, you want to verify their payment method has sufficient funds and lock those funds for fulfillment. The actual charge (capture) happens later when the order ships or service is delivered. This reduces chargebacks and improves cash flow management.

## Purpose

**Why use authorization instead of immediate charge?**

| Scenario | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **E-commerce fulfillment** | Verify funds at checkout, capture when order ships |
| **Hotel reservations** | Pre-authorize for incidentals, capture final amount at checkout |
| **Marketplace holds** | Secure funds from buyer before releasing to seller |
| **Subscription trials** | Validate card at signup, first charge after trial ends |

**Key outcomes:**
- Guaranteed funds availability (typically 7-10 days hold)
- Reduced fraud exposure through pre-verification
- Better customer experience (no double charges for partial shipments)
- Compliance with card network rules for delayed delivery
