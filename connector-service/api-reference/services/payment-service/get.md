## Overview

The `Get` RPC retrieves the current payment status from the payment processor. This enables synchronization between your system and payment processors for accurate state tracking, especially important for handling asynchronous webhook delays or recovering from system outages.

**Business Use Case:** When a customer refreshes their order page, or your system needs to verify a payment's current state before proceeding with fulfillment. Payment statuses can change asynchronously through webhooks, and `Get` ensures you have the most up-to-date information directly from the source.

## Purpose

**Why use Get instead of relying solely on webhooks?**

| Scenario | Developer Implementation |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Order status page** | Call `Get` when customer views order, display current status from `status` field |
| **Webhook recovery** | If webhook missed, call `Get` with `connector_transaction_id` to sync state |
| **Pre-fulfillment check** | Before shipping, call `Get` to confirm payment is CAPTURED, not just AUTHORIZED |
| **Multi-system sync** | Call `Get` periodically to reconcile payment state across microservices |
| **Dispute handling** | Call `Get` to verify payment details when responding to chargebacks |

**Key outcomes:**
- Accurate payment state for customer-facing displays
- Recovery from missed or delayed webhooks
- Confirmation before critical business actions (shipping, digital delivery)
- Audit trail verification for support inquiries

## Example

### Request (grpcurl)

```bash
grpcurl -H "x-connector: stripe" \
  -H "x-connector-auth: {\"Stripe\":{\"api_key\":\"$STRIPE_API_KEY\"}}" \
  -d '{
    "connector_transaction_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
    "test_mode": true
  }' \
  localhost:8080 \
  types.PaymentService/Get
```

### Response

```json
{
  "connector_transaction_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
  "status": "AUTHORIZED",
  "status_code": 200,
  "amount": {
    "minor_amount": 1000,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "captured_amount": 0,
  "capture_method": "MANUAL"
}
```

## Next Steps

- [Authorize](./authorize.md) - Authorize a new payment
- [Capture](./capture.md) - Finalize the payment and transfer funds
- [Void](./void.md) - Release held funds if order cancelled
