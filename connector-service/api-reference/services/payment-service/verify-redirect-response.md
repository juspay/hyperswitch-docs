## Overview

The `VerifyRedirectResponse` RPC validates the authenticity of payment responses received from redirect-based authentication flows. This includes 3D Secure (3DS) redirects, bank authentication pages, and wallet payment callbacks. It ensures the response genuinely came from the payment provider and hasn't been tampered with during transit.

**Business Use Case:** When a customer completes a 3DS challenge or bank redirect and is redirected back to your application, you need to verify that the response is legitimate. This prevents fraudsters from spoofing successful payment notifications and ensures you only fulfill orders for genuine successful payments.

## Purpose

**Why use VerifyRedirectResponse?**

| Scenario | Developer Implementation |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **3DS completion** | Customer returns from 3DS challenge - call `VerifyRedirectResponse` to validate the authentication result |
| **Bank redirect** | Customer returns from bank authentication page - call `VerifyRedirectResponse` to confirm payment success |
| **Wallet payment** | Customer completes Apple Pay or Google Pay - call `VerifyRedirectResponse` to verify the token |
| **Fraud prevention** | Suspicious redirect parameters detected - call `VerifyRedirectResponse` to validate before fulfilling order |
| **Tampering detection** | URL parameters appear modified - call `VerifyRedirectResponse` to verify integrity |

**Key outcomes:**
- Confirms redirect response authenticity
- Prevents fraudulent payment notifications
- Extracts verified transaction details
- Determines final payment status
- Enables safe order fulfillment

## Example

### Request (grpcurl)

```bash
grpcurl -H "x-connector: stripe" \
  -H "x-connector-auth: {\"Stripe\":{\"api_key\":\"$STRIPE_API_KEY\"}}" \
  -d '{
    "merchant_order_id": "order_001",
    "request_details": {
      "headers": [
        {"key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
      ],
      "query_params": [
        {"key": "payment_intent", "value": "pi_3Oxxx..."},
        {"key": "payment_intent_client_secret", "value": "pi_3Oxxx..._secret_xxx"}
      ],
      "body": ""
    }
  }' \
  localhost:8080 \
  ucs.v2.PaymentService/VerifyRedirectResponse
```

### Response

```json
{
  "source_verified": true,
  "connector_transaction_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
  "response_amount": {
    "minor_amount": 1000,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "merchant_order_id": "order_001",
  "status": "AUTHORIZED"
}
```

## Next Steps

- [Authorize](./authorize.md) - Initiate a payment that may require redirect authentication
- [Capture](./capture.md) - Finalize the payment after successful verification
- [Get](./get.md) - Check payment status after verification
- [PaymentMethodAuthenticationService](../payment-method-authentication-service/README.md) - Pre-authenticate before authorization
