## Overview

The `SetupRecurring` RPC establishes a payment mandate (recurring payment instruction) at the payment processor. This enables future charges without requiring the customer to re-enter payment details or be present for each transaction. It's the foundation of subscription billing, recurring donations, and automated bill payment systems.

**Business Use Case:** When setting up a SaaS subscription, monthly utility bill, insurance premium, or any service that bills customers on a recurring basis. The mandate represents the customer's consent for future charges and is stored securely at the processor, reducing PCI compliance scope and improving authorization rates.

## Purpose

**Why use SetupRecurring?**

| Scenario | Developer Implementation |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **SaaS subscriptions** | Customer signs up for monthly plan - call `SetupRecurring` to create mandate, then use mandate for recurring billing |
| **Utility bills** | Customer enrolls in auto-pay - call `SetupRecurring` to enable automatic monthly charges |
| **Membership renewals** | Gym or club membership - call `SetupRecurring` to set up annual renewal charges |
| **Installment payments** | Buy-now-pay-later setup - call `SetupRecurring` to create scheduled payment plan |
| **Donation programs** | Monthly charity donations - call `SetupRecurring` to enable recurring contributions |

**Key outcomes:**
- Mandate reference created for future charges
- Customer consent stored at processor level
- No PCI exposure for stored payment methods
- Higher authorization rates for repeat charges
- Compliance with SEPA and other mandate regulations
