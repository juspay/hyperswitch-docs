## Overview

The `Void` RPC cancels an authorized payment before it has been captured. This releases the held funds back to the customer's payment method, effectively canceling the transaction without charging the customer.

**Business Use Case:** When a customer cancels their order before it ships, or an item is out of stock after authorization. Void is the appropriate action when no funds have been transferred yet. Unlike refunds (which return captured funds), voids prevent the charge from ever occurring.

## Purpose

**Why use Void instead of Refund?**

| Scenario | Developer Implementation |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Order cancellation** | Customer cancels before shipping - call `Void` with `connector_transaction_id` to release held funds |
| **Out of stock** | Item unavailable after authorization - call `Void` to cancel authorization, no charge appears on customer statement |
| **Fraud detection** | Suspicious order flagged before capture - call `Void` to block the transaction entirely |
| **Duplicate prevention** | Accidental double authorization - call `Void` on the duplicate to release the hold |
| **Price adjustment** | Order total needs to change - `Void` the original, create new authorization with correct amount |

**Key outcomes:**
- No charge appears on customer's statement (authorization disappears within 1-3 business days)
- Funds immediately available to customer (vs. 5-10 days for refunds)
- Transaction moves to VOIDED status
- No settlement fees (vs. refund processing fees)

## Example

### Request (grpcurl)

```bash
grpcurl -H "x-connector: stripe" \
  -H "x-connector-config: {\"config\":{\"Stripe\":{\"api_key\":\"$STRIPE_API_KEY\"}}}" \
  -d '{
    "merchant_void_id": "void_001",
    "connector_transaction_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
    "cancellation_reason": "Customer requested cancellation",
    "merchant_order_id": "order-001",
    "test_mode": true
  }' \
  localhost:8080 \
  ucs.v2.PaymentService/Void
```

### Response

```json
{
  "connector_transaction_id": "pi_3Oxxx...",
  "status": "VOIDED",
  "status_code": 200
}
```

## Next Steps

- [Authorize](./authorize.md) - Authorize a new payment
- [Capture](./capture.md) - Finalize the payment and transfer funds
- [Get](./get.md) - Check current payment status
