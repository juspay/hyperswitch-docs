## Overview

The Merchant Authentication Service provides secure authentication mechanisms for payment processing. It generates short-lived access tokens for API access, session tokens for maintaining payment state, and SDK session tokens for wallet payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay.

**Business Use Cases:**
- **Client-side tokenization** - Generate tokens for browser/mobile apps without exposing API keys
- **Session management** - Maintain state across multi-step payment flows
- **Wallet payments** - Initialize Apple Pay, Google Pay sessions
- **Security compliance** - Avoid storing secrets in client applications

The service enables secure payment flows by providing temporary credentials that expire after a short duration, reducing the risk of credential compromise.

## Operations

| Operation | Description | Use When |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| [`CreateAccessToken`](./create-access-token.md) | Generate short-lived connector authentication token. Provides secure credentials for connector API access without storing secrets client-side. | Client applications need temporary API access |
| [`CreateSessionToken`](./create-session-token.md) | Create session token for payment processing. Maintains session state across multiple payment operations for improved security and tracking. | Multi-step payment flows requiring state persistence |
| [`CreateSdkSessionToken`](./create-sdk-session-token.md) | Initialize wallet payment sessions for Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. Sets up secure context for tokenized wallet payments with device verification. | Enabling Apple Pay, Google Pay checkout options |

## Common Patterns

### Secure Client-Side Payment Flow

Generate temporary tokens for client applications to process payments without exposing long-lived API credentials.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your App
    participant CS as Connector Service
    participant PP as Payment Provider
    participant Client as Client App

    Note over App: Server-side
    App->>CS: 1. CreateAccessToken
    CS->>PP: Request short-lived token
    PP-->>CS: Return access token
    CS-->>App: Return access_token (expires in 1 hour)
    App->>Client: Send token to client
    Note over Client: Client-side
    Client->>PP: Use token for card tokenization
    PP-->>Client: Return payment_method_token
    Client->>App: Send payment_method_token
    Note over App: Server-side
    App->>CS: 2. Authorize (with payment_method_token)
    CS->>PP: Process payment
    PP-->>CS: Return authorization
    CS-->>App: Return connector_transaction_id
```

**Flow Explanation:**

1. **CreateAccessToken** - Your server calls this RPC to generate a short-lived access token (typically 1 hour). This token has limited scope and can be safely sent to client applications (browsers, mobile apps) without exposing your main API credentials.

2. **Client tokenization** - The client uses this token to interact directly with the payment processor for operations like card tokenization. The temporary token limits exposure if the client is compromised.

3. **Server-side payment** - After the client obtains a payment method token, it sends it to your server. You then use your secure credentials to authorize the payment, keeping the sensitive payment processing on your trusted infrastructure.

### Apple Pay Integration

Initialize Apple Pay sessions for seamless mobile checkout.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer as Customer
    participant iOS as iOS App
    participant App as Your Backend
    participant CS as Connector Service
    participant PP as Payment Provider
    participant Apple as Apple Pay

    Note over Customer: Customer taps Apple Pay button
    iOS->>App: Request payment session
    App->>CS: 1. CreateSdkSessionToken (Apple Pay)
    CS->>PP: Initialize Apple Pay session
    PP-->>CS: Return session data
    CS-->>App: Return session_token
    App->>iOS: Send session token
    iOS->>Apple: Present Apple Pay sheet
    Customer->>Apple: Authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID
    Apple-->>iOS: Return encrypted payment token
    iOS->>App: Send Apple Pay token
    App->>CS: 2. Authorize (with Apple Pay token)
    CS->>PP: Process payment
    PP-->>CS: Return authorization
    CS-->>App: Return connector_transaction_id
```

**Flow Explanation:**

1. **CreateSdkSessionToken** - When a customer chooses Apple Pay, your backend calls this RPC with payment details (amount, merchant ID). The connector initializes an Apple Pay session with Apple's servers and returns session data.

2. **Present payment sheet** - Your iOS app uses the session token to present the native Apple Pay sheet. The customer authenticates using Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode.

3. **Process payment** - After customer authentication, Apple returns an encrypted payment token. Your backend receives this token and calls the Payment Service's `Authorize` RPC to complete the transaction.

## Security Best Practices

**Token Expiration:**
- Access tokens expire quickly (1 hour typical)
- Don't cache tokens long-term
- Generate new tokens for each session

**Scope Limitation:**
- Tokens have limited permissions
- Cannot perform sensitive operations
- Designed for specific use cases

**Server-Side Authorization:**
- Always process payments server-side
- Never authorize payments from client
- Use tokens only for tokenization/UI

- [Payment Method Service](../payment-method-service/README.md) - Tokenize payment methods
