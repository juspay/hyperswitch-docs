## Overview

The `Create` RPC creates a customer record at the payment processor. This stores customer information (name, email, phone, address) at the connector level, enabling streamlined future transactions without resending personal details.

**Business Use Case:** When a new customer signs up or makes their first purchase, you create their profile at the payment processor. This customer ID can then be used across multiple payment operations, improving authorization rates through customer history and enabling features like saved payment methods and recurring billing.

## Purpose

**Why create customer profiles at the payment processor?**

| Scenario | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Returning customers** | Faster checkout without re-entering personal information |
| **Recurring billing** | Link subscriptions to a consistent customer identity |
| **Multiple payment methods** | Organize stored cards/wallets under one customer |
| **Unified reporting** | Track all customer transactions in one view |

**Key outcomes:**
- Unique `connector_customer_id` for referencing this customer
- Consistent identity across all payment operations
- Foundation for payment method tokenization
- Improved authorization rates for repeat customers
