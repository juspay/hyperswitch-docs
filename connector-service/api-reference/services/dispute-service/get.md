## Overview

The `Get` RPC retrieves the current status and details of a dispute from the payment processor. Use this to track dispute progress, check evidence submission deadlines, and monitor resolution status.

**Business Use Case:** When you receive a dispute notification or need to check the status of an ongoing dispute, this RPC provides real-time information about the dispute state, evidence requirements, and resolution timeline.

## Purpose

**Why retrieve dispute status?**

| Scenario | Information Needed | Action |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| **New dispute notification** | Dispute reason, amount, deadline | Determine defense strategy |
| **Evidence deadline approaching** | Time remaining, evidence submitted | Submit evidence before cutoff |
| **Awaiting resolution** | Current status, bank review progress | Plan for potential loss/profit impact |
| **Dispute resolved** | Final status (WON/LOST), funds movement | Update accounting records |

**Key outcomes:**
- Current dispute status and stage
- Evidence submission deadline
- Dispute reason and amount
- Evidence already submitted
- Resolution timeline
