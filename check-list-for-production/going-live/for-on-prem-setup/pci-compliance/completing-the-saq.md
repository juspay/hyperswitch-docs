# Completing the SAQ

{% hint style="warning" %}
There are multiple [variants of SAQs](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Understanding_SAQs_PCI_DSS_v3.pdf) applicable for Merchants willing to be PCI compliant. This document explains compliance to SAQ D only.

Examples of merchant environments that would use SAQ D includes but not limited to:&#x20;

* **E-commerce merchants** who **accept cardholder data** on their website.
* Merchants with **electronic storage of cardholder data.**
* Merchants that donâ€™t store cardholder data electronically but that do not meet the criteria of another SAQ type.
{% endhint %}

The [Official SAQ D](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/SAQ_D_v3_Merchant.pdf) has approximately 300 questions to be answered. Most of the aspects are general infrastructure controls, access controls and organizational policies. Answering the questions will be a cake walk if you close few activities upfront. We have divided the activities into three categories.

This process, typically automated by Approved Scanning Vendors (ASVs), should be conducted quarterly and usually completes within a few hours.
2. **Complete SAQ D**: Fill out the SAQ D and retain a copy for your records.

It's essential to submit your network scan report and Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to your payment processor or acquirer.&#x20;
