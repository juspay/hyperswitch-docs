# ðŸ’³ PCI Compliance

Hyperswitch Cloud offers **out-of-the-box PCI compliance**, so that you do not have to worry about securing and storing customers's cards.

## PCI DSS Level 1 compliance <a href="#docs-internal-guid-959e0903-7fff-fc13-1542-001b2640a715" id="docs-internal-guid-959e0903-7fff-fc13-1542-001b2640a715"></a>

Hyperswitch is Level 1 PCI DSS 3.2.1 certified which is the strictest level of compliance to handle card data securely.

The infrastructure and application are annually audited with a PCI approved scanning vendor to keep the PCI compliance up to date.

## Enabling raw card acceptance with payment processors <a href="#docs-internal-guid-959e0903-7fff-fc13-1542-001b2640a715" id="docs-internal-guid-959e0903-7fff-fc13-1542-001b2640a715"></a>

While you are using Hyperswitch, your customers' cards will be securely tokenized and stored on Hyperswitch Cloud vault.&#x20;

However this will require the payment processors to enable raw card acceptance at their end (which most payment processor do not offer as default setting). You will have to send Hyperswitch PCI AOC to your payment processor's support team and request to enable the setting against your merchant account.

> Stripe used to allow merchants to enable raw card processing in S2S API requests via its Merchant Dashboard, but this feature has recently been [deprecated](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enabling-access-to-raw-card-data-apis).&#x20;
>
> To enable this, you must share your or the third-party service provider's PCI DSS compliance certificate, which will process the raw card data for Stripe support. If you are using Hyperswitch for this, you can download it from the Hyperswitch Dashboard under the Compliance section under settings.
