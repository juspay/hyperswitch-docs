# ID and Object Modeling

The whole complexity in the payment integrations exist beacuse all payment processors could not agree on how to name their IDs, and how many IDs are needs to process a payment. And to add to this complexity, 
- some processor use the ID you pass a the primary reference, whereas othe processor generate their own primary IDs
- some processor also provide upstream IDs (crom issuer, acquirer etc.,) to enable merchant with more granular information of the transaction flow

This inconsistency breaks code completion, confuses LLMs, and forces you to maintain different ID handling logic for every connector - whether to send an ID, or expect the connector to create its own ID?

Prism is stateless service, so it does not create any new IDs
But the important aspect is that, Prism solves the ID problem with a well solidified grammar in the interface that uses strongly-typed, self-describing identifiers regardless of the underlying processor, network, issuer or any other

## Modelling IDs with clear pattern

The interface of Prism always uses typed IDs with a consistent format: `entity_domain_id`. So developers using the interface shall have clarity, and all the processor complexity is handled behind the scenes.

### What is Entity?
The stakeholder/system that owns the generation of the ID. Let see how a transaction ID is spread across multiple entity in a transaction lifecyle.

| Entity | Prism Field | Who Generates | Purpose |
|-------|----|--------------|---------|
| **Merchant** | `merchant_transaction_id` | You (the merchant) | Your internal reference for a particular transactions |
| **Connector** | `connector_transaction_id` | Payment processor (Stripe, Adyen) | Processor's reference for the transaction |
| **Acquirer** | `acquirer_transaction_id` | Acquiring bank | Bank-level reference for settlement |
| **Network** | `network_transaction_id` | Card network (Visa, Mastercard) | Network-level trace for disputes and chargebacks |
| **Issuer** | `issuer_transaction_id` | Cardholder's bank | Issuing bank's reference for the cardholder statement |

### What is Domain?
The domain in which the ID should be interpreted. Below are the reference ID fields from the perspective of a single entity (merchant) and but across domains.

| Domain | Prism Field | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Payment** | `merchant_transaction_id` | Your reference for a payment transaction |
| **Order** | `merchant_order_id` | Your order reference for the payment |
| **Refund** | `merchant_refund_id` | Your reference for a refund |
| **Recurring Charge** | `merchant_charge_id` | Your reference for recurring payments |
| **Event** | `merchant_event_id` | Your reference for webhook events |

Your ID handling becomes simple, safe, and portable across all connectors, if you use and persist the same terminology in your payment system.
