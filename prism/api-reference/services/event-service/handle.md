## Overview

The `Handle` RPC processes raw webhook payloads from payment processors. It verifies webhook signatures, parses the event data, and returns a normalized response with the event type and associated payment/refund/dispute details.

**Business Use Case:** When payment processors send webhook notifications to your endpoint, you need to verify they're authentic, understand what happened, and update your system accordingly. This RPC handles the verification and parsing so you can focus on business logic.

## Purpose

**Why use the Event Service for webhooks?**

| Challenge | How Handle RPC Helps |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Signature verification** | Automatically verifies webhook authenticity using connector secrets |
| **Multiple connector formats** | Normalizes Stripe, Adyen, PayPal events into consistent format |
| **Event parsing** | Extracts payment/refund/dispute IDs and status from complex payloads |
| **Security** | Validates webhook secrets before processing |

**Key outcomes:**
- Verified webhook authenticity
- Normalized event structure
- Extracted entity details (payment, refund, dispute)
- Ready-to-process event data
