## Overview

The Event Service processes webhook notifications from payment processors. Instead of polling APIs for status updates, this service receives real-time events when payment states change, enabling immediate response to successful payments, failed transactions, refunds, and disputes.

**Business Use Cases:**
- **Real-time order fulfillment** - Trigger shipping when payment succeeds
- **Failed payment handling** - Retry or notify customers immediately
- **Refund tracking** - Update order status when refunds complete
- **Dispute notifications** - Alert teams when chargebacks are filed
- **Reconciliation** - Keep your system in sync with processor state

The service handles events from all supported connectors, normalizing them into a consistent format regardless of the source.

## Operations

| Operation | Description | Use When |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| [`Handle`](./handle.md) | Process webhook notifications from connectors. Translates connector events into standardized responses for asynchronous payment state updates. | Receiving webhook callbacks from any payment processor |

## Common Patterns

### Webhook Processing Flow

Receive and process webhook events to keep your system synchronized with payment processor state.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PP as Payment Provider
    participant App as Your App
    participant CS as Connector Service

    Note over PP: Payment state changes
    PP->>App: POST /webhook (event payload)
    App->>CS: 1. Handle (event data)
    CS->>CS: Verify webhook signature
    CS->>CS: Parse and normalize event
    CS-->>App: Return parsed event with type
    Note over App: Process based on event type
    alt Payment succeeded
        App->>App: Trigger order fulfillment
    else Payment failed
        App->>App: Notify customer, retry
    else Refund completed
        App->>App: Update order status
    else Dispute opened
        App->>App: Alert support team
    end
```

**Flow Explanation:**

1. **Receive webhook** - Payment processors send webhook notifications to your configured endpoint when events occur (payment success, failure, refund, dispute, etc.).

2. **Handle** - Forward the raw webhook payload to the Event Service's `Handle` RPC. The service verifies the webhook signature to ensure it's authentic, then parses and normalizes the event into a standard format regardless of which connector sent it.

3. **Process event** - Based on the returned `event_type` and `event_response`, take appropriate action in your system. The response includes the full payment/refund/dispute details so you can update your database and trigger business logic.

**Common Event Types:**
- `PAYMENT_INTENT_SUCCESS` - Payment completed successfully
- `PAYMENT_INTENT_PAYMENT_FAILED` - Payment attempt failed
- `CHARGE_REFUNDED` - Refund was processed
- `DISPUTE_CREATED` - New chargeback filed
- `DISPUTE_CLOSED` - Dispute resolved

### Reliable Webhook Processing

Handle webhook delivery failures and ensure events are processed even during outages.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PP as Payment Provider
    participant App as Your App
    participant CS as Connector Service
    participant Queue as Message Queue

    Note over PP: Payment succeeds
    PP->>App: POST /webhook (event payload)
    alt Webhook endpoint available
        App->>CS: 1. Handle (event data)
        CS-->>App: Return parsed event
        App->>Queue: Enqueue for processing
        App-->>PP: Return 200 OK
        Queue->>App: Process event
        App->>App: Update order, trigger fulfillment
    else Webhook endpoint down
        App-->>PP: Return 5xx error
        PP->>PP: Schedule retry
        Note over PP: Retry after 1 min, 5 min, 15 min...
        PP->>App: Retry webhook delivery
        App->>CS: Handle (event data)
        CS-->>App: Return parsed event
        App-->>PP: Return 200 OK
    end
```

**Flow Explanation:**

1. **Receive webhook** - Your endpoint receives the webhook POST request from the payment processor.

2. **Handle and verify** - Call the `Handle` RPC to verify the webhook signature and parse the event. Return a 200 OK response to the processor immediately to acknowledge receipt.

3. **Queue for processing** - Instead of processing synchronously, enqueue the event in a message queue (Redis, RabbitMQ, SQS, etc.). This prevents timeouts and handles retries if your processing fails.

4. **Process asynchronously** - Workers consume from the queue and process events. This decouples webhook receipt from business logic execution.

**Retry Handling:**
- Return 2xx status to stop retries
- Return 5xx status to trigger processor retry
- Processors typically retry 3-5 times with exponential backoff

## Security Considerations

**Webhook Verification:**
The Event Service automatically verifies webhook signatures using the connector's webhook secrets. This ensures events are genuinely from the payment processor and haven't been tampered with.

**Idempotency:**
Payment processors may send the same event multiple times (retries). Use the `merchant_event_id` to deduplicate events in your system.

**Timeout Handling:**
Process webhooks quickly and return 200 OK. If processing takes longer than 10-30 seconds, some processors will retry. Use a queue for heavy processing.
