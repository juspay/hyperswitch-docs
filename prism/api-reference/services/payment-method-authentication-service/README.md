## Overview

The Payment Method Authentication Service manages 3D Secure (3DS) authentication flows for card payments. It verifies cardholder identity through frictionless or challenge-based authentication to reduce fraud liability while maintaining a smooth checkout experience.

**Business Use Cases:**
- **Fraud prevention** - Verify cardholder identity for high-risk transactions
- **SCA compliance** - Meet Strong Customer Authentication requirements (EU)
- **Liability shift** - Transfer fraud liability to the issuing bank
- **Risk-based authentication** - Skip authentication for low-risk transactions

The service supports the complete 3DS flow: pre-authentication (device data collection), authentication (challenge or frictionless), and post-authentication (result validation).

## Operations

| Operation | Description | Use When |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| [`PreAuthenticate`](./pre-authenticate.md) | Initiate 3DS flow before payment authorization. Collects device data and prepares authentication context for frictionless or challenge-based verification. | Starting a 3DS authentication flow |
| [`Authenticate`](./authenticate.md) | Execute 3DS challenge or frictionless verification. Authenticates customer via bank challenge or behind-the-scenes verification for fraud prevention. | Customer needs to complete 3DS challenge |
| [`PostAuthenticate`](./post-authenticate.md) | Validate authentication results with the issuing bank. Processes bank's authentication decision to determine if payment can proceed. | Verifying 3DS completion before payment |

## Common Patterns

### Frictionless 3DS Flow

Low-risk transactions pass authentication without customer interaction.

    participant Customer as Customer
    participant App as Your App
    participant CS as Connector Service
    participant PP as Payment Provider
    participant Bank as Issuing Bank

    Note over Customer: Customer enters card details
    Customer->>App: Submit payment
    App->>CS: 1. PreAuthenticate
    CS->>PP: Initialize 3DS session
    PP->>Bank: Request authentication
    Bank-->>PP: Frictionless authentication (low risk)
    PP-->>CS: Return authentication data
    CS-->>App: Return auth data (no challenge)
    Note over App: Authentication complete
    App->>CS: 2. Authorize (with auth data)
    CS->>PP: Process payment
    PP-->>CS: Return authorization
    CS-->>App: Return connector_transaction_id (AUTHORIZED)
```

**Flow Explanation:**

1. **PreAuthenticate** - After the customer enters their card details, call this RPC to initiate 3DS. The connector sends device data, transaction amount, and merchant info to the issuing bank. For low-risk transactions (based on amount, device fingerprint, merchant history), the bank approves frictionlessly.

2. **Authorize payment** - If frictionless authentication succeeds, the response includes authentication data (ECI, CAVV values). Pass this to the Payment Service's `Authorize` RPC. The liability for fraud shifts to the issuing bank.

### Challenge-Based 3DS Flow

High-risk transactions require customer verification through bank challenge.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer as Customer
    participant App as Your App
    participant CS as Connector Service
    participant PP as Payment Provider
    participant Bank as Issuing Bank

    Note over Customer: Customer enters card details
    Customer->>App: Submit payment
    App->>CS: 1. PreAuthenticate
    CS->>PP: Initialize 3DS session
    PP->>Bank: Request authentication
    Bank-->>PP: Challenge required (high risk)
    PP-->>CS: Return challenge URL
    CS-->>App: Return redirection_data
    App->>Customer: Redirect to bank challenge page
    Customer->>Bank: Enter OTP/password
    Bank->>Bank: Verify credentials
    Bank->>App: Redirect back with result
    App->>CS: 2. PostAuthenticate (with result)
    CS->>PP: Validate authentication
    PP-->>CS: Return validation
    CS-->>App: Return auth confirmation
    Note over App: Authentication complete
    App->>CS: 3. Authorize (with auth data)
    CS->>PP: Process payment
    PP-->>CS: Return authorization
    CS-->>App: Return connector_transaction_id (AUTHORIZED)
```

**Flow Explanation:**

1. **PreAuthenticate** - Initiate 3DS authentication. For high-risk transactions, the bank responds that a challenge is required. The response includes `redirection_data` with a URL to the bank's challenge page.

2. **Customer challenge** - Redirect the customer to the bank's challenge page where they enter an OTP sent to their phone, answer a security question, or provide a password. After verification, the bank redirects back to your app.

3. **PostAuthenticate** - After the customer returns from the challenge, call this RPC with the authentication result data. The connector validates the result with the bank and confirms authentication success.

4. **Authorize payment** - With successful 3DS authentication, call the Payment Service's `Authorize` RPC including the authentication data. The payment proceeds with liability protection.

## 3DS Decision Factors

Banks consider these factors for frictionless vs challenge:

| Factor | Low Risk (Frictionless) | High Risk (Challenge) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Transaction amount** | Small amounts | Large amounts |
| **Device fingerprint** | Known device | New/unknown device |
| **Merchant history** | Established merchant | New merchant |
| **Customer history** | Repeat customer | First-time customer |
| **Location** | Home country | Foreign country |
| **Time** | Normal hours | Unusual hours |
