### Activating Stripe via Hyperswitch

#### Prerequisites

1. You need to be registered with Stripe in order to proceed. In case you aren't, you can quickly setup your Stripe account [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
2. You should have a registered Hyperswitch account. You can access your account from the [Hyperswitch control center](https://app.hyperswitch.io/).
3. Enable handling raw card data for your Stripe account by sending a request to the stripe support (Visit [here](https://docs.hyperswitch.io/security-and-compliance/pci-compliance#docs-internal-guid-959e0903-7fff-fc13-1542-001b2640a715-1) for more details).  This will enable Hyperswitch to securely handle your customer's payment details in a PCI compliant manner.
4. Enter your Country, Business Label and Stripe API Key. The Stripe API key can be found in your Stripe dashboard under \[Developers -> API keys]\(https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) as \*\*Secret Key\*\*\
   Note: Ensure to use the Secret Key -> Starts with \`sk\`
5. Select all the payment methods you wish to use Stripe for. Ensure that this is the same as the ones configured on your Stripe dashboard under Settings -> Payments -> Payment methods
6. Webhooks: Navigate to the webhooks section of your Stripe dashboard (Developers -> Webhooks) and create a new webhook by clicking on \`Add an endpoint\`.

### Configuring webhooks

This will ensure that if your Stripe transaction was sent through Hyperswitch,

* Stripe sends webhooks to Hyperswitch endpoint in Step 2
* Hyperswitch sends these corresponding webhooks to your endpoint in Step 1
