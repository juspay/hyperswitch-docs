- Go to the [add MerchantIDs section](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/merchant), select Merchant IDs and click Continue
- Add a useful description _(like merchant id for test environment)_
- Enter a unique descriptive identifier _(like merchant.com.testdomain.sandbox)_ and click Continue
- Verify the description and identifier and click on Register

## **Validating Merchant Domain**

## **Creating Apple MerchantID Certificate and Private Key**

You can create an Apple MerchantID certificate and private key by following the steps mentioned below -

**Note:** It is recommended that you keep all the generated files in the same workspace for the sake of simplicity

- Open a terminal and create **.csr** and **.key** file using the following command -

```cmd
openssl req -out uploadMe.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout certificate_sandbox.key
```

- Enter your details asked in the prompt. You will get a **.csr** and **.key** file
- Log in to your [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list), go to Identifiers and select the Merchant ID you created previously

- Upload the **.csr** file you just created by running the command _(it would be called **uploadMe.csr** if you copy-pasted the command)_ and click on Continue
- You will get a **.cer** file on clicking on Download _(it will probably be named **merchant_id.cer**)_

- Feature Request:
  We are using Hyperswitch, a Level 1 PCI DSS 3.2.1 compliant Payments Orchestrator, to manage payments on our website. In addition to Stripe, since we are using other processors as well to process payments across multiple geographies, we wanted to use Hyperswitch’s Payment Processing certificate to decrypt Apple pay tokens and send the decrypted Apple pay tokens to Stripe. So, please enable processing decrypted Apple pay token feature on our Stripe account. We’ve attached Hyperswitch’s PCI DSS AoC for reference.
