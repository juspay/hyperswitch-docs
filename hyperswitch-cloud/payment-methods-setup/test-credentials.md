**Step 2**: Goto Smart Router > Simple Configuration

**Step 3**: Add all the Gateways you wish to test and set highest priority to your target Gateway

**Step 4**: Go to Home > Preview Checkout, to open the Unified Checkout (this will be a refelection of payment experience which your customer will get)

**Step 5**: Enter card details as per the table below. Please note that test credentials varies across each connector.
